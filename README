Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Likwid is a simple to install and use toolsuite of command line applications
for performance oriented programmers. It works for Intel and AMD processors
on the Linux operating system.

It consists of:

likwid-topology   - print thread, cache and NUMA topology
likwid-perfctr    - configure and read out hardware performance counters on 
                    Intel and AMD processors
likwid-powermeter - read out RAPL Energy information and get info about Turbo 
                    mode steps
likwid-pin        - pin your threaded application (pthread, Intel and gcc OpenMP
                    to dedicated processors)
likwid-bench      - Micro benchmarking platform
likwid-genTopoCfg - Dumps topology information to a file
likwid-mpirun     - Wrapper to start MPI and Hybrid MPI/OpenMP applications
                    (Supports Intel MPI, OpenMPI and MPICH)
likwid-perfscope  - Frontend to the timeline mode of likwid-perfctr, plots live
                    graphs of performance metrics using gnuplot
likwid-agent      - Monitoring agent for hardware performance counters
likwid-memsweeper - Sweep memory of NUMA domains and evict cachelines from the
                    last level cache
likwid-setFrequencies - Tool to control the CPU frequency

See INSTALL for installation hints.
