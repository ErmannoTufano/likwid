 *
 *      Description:  Measure runtime with getTimeOfday and rdtsc.
 *
 *      A C module to measure runtime. There are two methods: with gettimeofday
 *      for longer time periods (over 0.5 sec) and with rdtsc (read time stamp
 *      counter) for shorter periods. There is a variation for measurements
 *      with rdtsc of 100 cycles in the worst case. Therefore sensible
 *      measurements should be over 1000 cycles.
 *
 *      Version:   <VERSION>
 *      Released:  <DATE>
